# Linnaeus4D
Shortly, it is Better-Software &amp; Cheaper-Hardware, for environmental planning.  It will make it cheaper to apply the best methods for environmental impact assessments or smart-agriculture (e.g., from 2D GIS to 4D complex systems sim.).  But more importantly, it will make it easier to report and credit people/actions which actually improve ecosystems function (e.g., Co2 Sequestration).  As Greta and George remind us, it will help make sure, from now on, that more than ~2% of funds meant to solve the climate crises, actually fund natural solutions (not technocratic pet-projects).
